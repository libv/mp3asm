  Quite a usefull lil app in my honest opinion.

  Why?

  Well, most ppl probably prefer decoding, wav editing, reencoding, but
that has consequences.
  Encoders use advanced filtering to create audio data thats easy to
compress while ppl can hardly tell the difference (depending on BR
offcourse) and then they compress that filtered audiodata. Now filtering
once from original full range unfiltered audio will provide the nicest
result. Every subsequent filtering will result in more loss of data, cos
the only real difference between encoders is the filterbanks.
  And offcourse, u dont have to waste precious cycles on the whole lengthy
process.

  Yes indeed, with wavediting programs u can edit right up to the
millisecond, or even better. But to be honest, an 128kbps mpeg 1 layer 3
file has 25 frames per second, which means u can cut right down to
40ms. If i dont mind the quality of a 128kbps file, how can u mind a few
inaudible millisecs?

  So when this app is up and running theres no more reason to waste a
perfectly good rip cos of a few bad starting frames or a long lead out.
At this point i even believe it should be possible to provide for fading
in/out, i aint certain yet actually :)
